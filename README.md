The analysis of Zomato's ratings reveals two important findings:

1. High count of "Not Rated": A significant portion of the ratings in the dataset are labeled as "Not Rated." This indicates a considerable number of instances where users did not provide a specific rating for the restaurants they visited or ordered from.

2. Ratings concentrated between 2.4 to 3.4: The majority of the given ratings fall within the range of 2.4 to 3.4. This suggests that a significant proportion of customers tend to rate their dining experiences in this particular range, indicating a consistent trend in the perception of the quality of service or food.

These observations shed light on the user feedback landscape on Zomato, highlighting a high count of "Not Rated" instances and a concentration of ratings in the 2.4 to 3.4 range. Further analysis can be conducted to explore the factors influencing these trends and their impact on the overall user experience.
